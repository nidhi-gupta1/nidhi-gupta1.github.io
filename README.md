# Full Stack Developer

I am having 5+ years of overall industrial experience. I started my career in HR Management after persuing my MBA in HR.
After working in that role for 3 years and gaining knowledge, due to some family circumstances I had to switch my career into Administration
where I took the role of marketing and sales head in one of a branch of a multi-national school in india. After working there for 2.5 years,
I moved to Finland with family and blessed with my second child. My daugher has started going to daycare and I am eager to continue with
my career. As consulted with TE, they suggested me to pursue career in IT.

I am a quick learner and very flexible. During past few monthsthrough self learning, i have gained working knowledge of multiple key technologies, as listed below.
I am confident that if I got an opportunity to work in this field, I will be very beneficial resource. My diverse experience gives me an extra
advantage of looking at the things from different angles.
